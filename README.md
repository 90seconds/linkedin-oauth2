# LinkedIn

OAuth 2.0 Ruby wrapper for the [LinkedIn API](http://developer.linkedin.com).

If you are using OAuth 1.0, see the [hexgnu/linkedin](https://github.com/hexgnu/linkedin)

If you are upgrading from the v0.1 version of this gem, see the upgrade
notes below.

# Installation

In Bundler:

```ruby
gem "linkedin-oauth2", "~> 1.0"
```

Otherwise:

    [sudo|rvm] gem install linkedin-oauth2

# Usage

**Step 1:** [Register](https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer) your
application with LinkedIn. They will give you a **Client ID** (aka API
Key) and a **Client Secret** (aka Secret Key)

**Step 2:** Use your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to obtain an **Access Token** from some user.

**Step 3:** Use an **Access Token** to query the API.

## Step 1: Register your Application

You first need to create and register an application with LinkedIn
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer).

You will not be able to use any part of the API without registering first.

Once you have registered you will need to take note of a few key items on
your Application Details page.

1. **API Key** - We refer to this as your client id or `client_id`
1. **Secret Key** - We refer to this as your client secret or
   `client_secret`
1. **Default Scope** - This is the set of permissions you request from
   users when they connect to your app. If you want to set this on a
   request-by-request basis, you can use the `scope` option with the
   `auth_code_url` method.
1. **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs** - For security reasons, the url you enter
   in this box must exactly match the `redirect_uri` you use in this gem.

You do NOT need **OAuth User Token** nor **OAuth User Secret**. That is
for OAuth 1.0. This gem is for OAuth 2.0.

## Step 2: Getting An Access Token

All LinkedIn API requests must be made in the context of an access token.
The access token encodes what LinkedIn information your AwesomeAppÂ® can
gather on behalf of "John Doe".

There are a few different ways to get an access token from a user.

1. You can use [LinkedIn's Javascript API](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/javascript-api-reference-0) to authenticate on the front-end and then pass the access token to the backend via [this procedure](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/exchange-jsapi-tokens-rest-api-oauth-tokens).

1. If you use OmniAuth, I would recommend looking at [decioferreira/omniauth-linkedin-oauth2](https://github.com/decioferreira/omniauth-linkedin-oauth2) to help automate authentication.

1. You can do it manually using this linkedin-oauth2 gem and the steps
   below.

Here is how to get an access token using this linkedin-oauth2 gem:

### Step 2A: Configuration

You will need to configure the following items:

1. Your **client id** (aka API Key)
1. Your **client secret** (aka Secret Key)
1. Your **redirect uri**. On LinkedIn's website you must input a list of
   valid redirect URIs. If you use the same one each time, you can set it
   in the `LinkedIn.configure` block. If your redirect uris change
   depending on business logic, you can pass it into the `auth_code_url`
   method.

```ruby
# It's best practice to keep secret credentials out of source code.
# You can, of course, hardcode dev keys or directly pass them in as the
# first two arguments of LinkedIn::OAuth2.new
LinkedIn.configure do |config|
  config.client_id     = ENV["LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID"]
  config.client_secret = ENV["LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET"]

  # This must exactly match the redirect URI you set on your application's
  # settings page. If your redirect_uri is dynamic, pass it into
  # `auth_code_url` instead.
  config.redirect_uri  = "https://getawesomeapp.io/linkedin/oauth2"
end
```

### Step 2B: Get Auth Code URL

```ruby
@oauth = LinkedIn::OAuth2.new

url = @oauth.auth_code_url
```

### Step 2C: User Sign In

You must now load url from Step 2B in a browser. It will pull up the
LinkedIn sign in box. Once LinkedIn user credentials are entered, the box
will close and redirect to your redirect url, passing along with it the
**OAuth code** as the `code` GET param.

Be sure to read the extended documentation around the LinkedIn::OAuth2
module for more options you can set.

**Note:** The **OAuth code** only lasts for ~20 seconds!

### Step 2D: Get Access Token

```ruby
code = "THE_OAUTH_CODE_LINKEDIN_GAVE_ME"

access_token = @oauth.get_access_token(code)
```

Now that you have an access token, you can use it to query the API.

The `LinkedIn::OAuth2` inherits from [intreda/oauth2](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2)'s `OAuth2::Client` class. See that gem's [documentation](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2/blob/master/lib/oauth2/client.rb) for more usage examples.

## Step 3: Using LinkedIn's API

Once you have an access token, you can query LinkedIn's API.

Your access token encodes the permissions you're allowed to have. See Step
2 and [this LinkedIn document](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication#granting) for how to change the permissions. See each section's documentation on LinkedIn for more information on what permissions get you access to.

### Authenticate Overview

LinkedIn's API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Luckily, this gem hides most of the gory details from you.

The gory details can be found [here](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication)

For legacy support of LinkedIn's OAuth 1.0a api, refer to the [pengwynn/linkedin](https://github.com/pengwynn/linkedin) gem.

Basically, you need 3 things to start using LinkedIn's API:

1. Your application's `client_id` aka **API Key**
1. Your application's `client_secret` aka **Secret Key**
1. An `access_token` from a user who authorized your app.

### If you already have a user's `access_token`
Then you have already authenticated! Encoded within that access token are
all of the permissions you have on a given user. Assuming you requested
the appropriate permissions, you can read their profile, grab connections,
etc.

    client = LinkedIn::Client.new("<your client_id>",
                                  "<your client_secret>",
                                  "<user access_token>")
    client.profile

You may also use the `set_access_token` method.

    client.set_access_token("<user access_token>", options)

### If you need to fetch an `access_token` for a user.
There are 4 steps:

1. Setup a client using your application's `client_id` and `client_secret`

    client = LinkedIn::Client.new('your_client_id', 'your_client_secret')

2. Get the `authorize_url` to bring up the page that will ask a user
   to verify permissions & grant you access.

    authorize_url = client.authorize_url

3. Once a user signs in to your OAuth 2.0 box, you will get an
   `auth_code` aka **code**. (Check in url you were directed to after a
   successful auth). Use this **auth code** to request the
   **access token**.

    access_token = client.request_access_token("<auth_code from last step>")

4. Once you have an `access_token`, you can request profile information or
   anything else you have permissions for.

    client.profile

### Profile examples
```ruby
# get the profile for the authenticated user
client.profile

# get a profile for someone found in network via ID
client.profile(:id => 'gNma67_AdI')

# get a profile for someone via their public profile url
client.profile(:url => 'http://www.linkedin.com/in/netherland')
```

## Migration from OAuth 1.0a to OAuth 2.0
### Overall changes
* The term `consumer` is now referred to as the `client`
* The terms `token`, `consumer token`, or `consumer key` in OAuth 1.0 are now referred to as **`client_id`** in OAuth 2.0
* The terms `secret`, or `consumer secret` in OAuth 1.0 are now referred to as **`client_secret`** in OAuth 2.0
* In OAuth 1.0 there is both an `auth token` and an `auth secret`. OAuth 2.0 combines these into a single `access token`.
* The terms `auth token`, `auth key`, `auth secret`, `access secret`, `access token`, or `access key` have all been collapsed and are now referred to as the **`access token`**.
* `require` `linkedin-oauth2` instead of `linkedin`
* Removed proxy options

### Gem api changes
* In general, any place that said "consumer" now says "client"
* The `authorize_from_request` method has been deprecated. Instead
  navigate to the url from `authorize_url` then enter the returned code
  into the `request_access_token` method.
* The `authorize_from_access` method has been deprecated. Instead
  initialize the `LinkedIn::Client.new` with the `access_token`.
  `client = Linkedin::Client.new(client_id, client_secret, access_token)`


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Testing
Run `bundle install`
